# Kheimon-A-Weather-Predicting-Program

A Python-based Weather Predication App which uses Linear Regression Algorithm to predict the weather to an accuracy nearest to 1 and is extreamely accurate its is comperatively a simpler machine learning algorithm which uses linear relationship to commute further data.It also uses a very dynamic Weather API to collect recent weather data(15 days by default) and stores it as a CSV(comma-seperated-value) file format for the python program to process and then display graphically and use it to diplay the weather for N days and has the capibility to work on 9 major Indian cities.

## Features:

Has a simple Python GUI(General User Interface) based on Tkinter library.

Has A streamlined API-based program which collects weather data from last 15 days dynamically depending on the current date and saves it in a CSV file in local device. 

The data used for linear regression is also retrived from **WeatherApi.com** as it offers historical weather data for analysis for free and easier to call data parsing purposes.

The model currently works sucessfully on 9 Indian Cities and program is able to provide accurate data for the cities.

It also uses **Numpy,Pandas and Matplotlib** libraries for dataset manipulation and for data visualisation a crucial part of Machine Learning Algorithm.Its uses a scatter plot to plot *Temperature and Windspeed* , two parameters on basis of which the linear regression model predicts the temperature and windspeed and also plots the data in simple graphs.

Tablle also diplays the predicted temperature and windspeed as predicted using linear regression and data from Weather-API.

## Setup:

**Needs python 3.11.2 to work properly:**
Navigate to the project directory:

```cd Kheimon```

```python dependencies.py```

```python complete_project.py```

automatically works in command line.

## Tkinter Windows:
